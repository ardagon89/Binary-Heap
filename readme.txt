How to compile and run the code:
-------
1) The command prompt path should be in "sxa190016" directory
2) javac BinaryHeap.java
3) java BinaryHeap

The class BoundedQueue models the functionalities of
a binary heap and implements offer(), poll(), peek(), add(), resize() and other methods. We have used
the main function to run and test the class functions. 

The procedure to run is as follows:

When you run the main function, it will
1. Create an unordered String array
2. Create a BinaryHeap to store the elements of the String array
3. Print the original order of elements in the array
4. Print the size of the heap
5. Offer 3 more elements to resize the heap
6. Print the size of the heap
7. Print the order of elements in the heap
8. Store the elements back into the array in an ordered fashion
9. Print the sorted order of elements in the array
10. Create an integer array of elements
11. Create BinaryHeap for integers
12. Save the elements in the Binary Heap in unordered fashion
13. Set the size of the heap
14. Heapify the unordered elements in the heap
15. Print the order of elements in the heapified heap-array pq
